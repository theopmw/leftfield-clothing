## **Site Goals**

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development Diploma, specifically for the **Full Stack Frameworks** module. The objective of this project is to "build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset". The site features an authentication mechanism and provides paid access to the site's data based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product.
